# User stories
Project Goal: To create a virtual “medal” holder where users input information about their races.


### Auth:
1. As a user, I want to be able to create an account username and password- sign up.
1. As a user, I want to be able to sign into the app using the username and password I created.
1. As a user, I want to be able to change my password.
1. As a user, I want to be able to sign out.

### Core RQs:
1. As a user, I want to be able to “create/log” a race distance and time I have ran.
  1.1 User enters:
    1.1.1 Race Date
    1.1.2 Race Time- Hours, Mins, Seconds
      1.1.2.1 If a field is left blank- default to zero
      1.1.2.2 Mins is the only field required
      1.1.2.3 Open question- can they enter 1:01 as 61 and will it still work
  	1.2.1 Race Distance- Drop Down box
	      1.2.1.1 Half
	      1.2.1.2 Full
    1.3.1 Race Name
	  1.4.1 Race Location
2. As a user, I want to be able to edit a race and distance and time I have ran.
	1. Editable fields are:
	        1. All fields
3. As a user, I want to be able to delete a race I have ran.
4. As a user, I want to see all the races I have ran.
	1. Default sort list by date


### R2:
1. As a user, when I log in, I want to see a view of all my PRs for each distance.
1. As a user, when I create a race, I want the app to calculate and save my pace.
1. As a user, on the All Races Page, I want to be able to sort the list by:
Race Type

### R3:
1. Photo upload for each race


## Dependencies

Install with `npm install`.

-   [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io)
-   [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)
-   [Handlebars.js](http://handlebarsjs.com)

At the beginning of each cohort, update the versions in
[`package.json`](package.json) by replace all versions with a glob (`*`) and
running `npm update --save && npm update --save-dev`. You may wish to test these
changes by deleting the `node_modules` directory and running `npm install`.
Fix any conflicts.

## Installation

1.  [Download](../../archive/master.zip) this template.
1.  Unzip and rename the template directory.
1.  Empty [`README.md`](README.md) and fill with your own content.
1.  Move into the new project and `git init`.
1.  Install dependencies with `npm install`.

## Structure

Dependencies are stored in [`package.json`](package.json).

Do not configure `grunt` packages directly in the
[`Gruntfile.js`](Gruntfile.js). Instead, store configurations in the
[`grunt`](grunt) directory. You won't need a top-level key, since that's
generated by the `Gruntfile.js` based on the filename of the configuration
object stored in the `grunt` directory.

Developers should store JavaScript files in [`assets/scripts`](assets/scripts).
The "manifest" or entry-point is
[`assets/scripts/index.js`](assets/scripts/index.js). In general, only
application initialization goes in this file. It's normal for developers to
start putting all code in this file, but encourage them to break out different
responsibilities and use the `require` syntax put references where they're
needed.

Developers should set `config.apiOrigins.production` (and
`config.apiOrigins.development` if it differs from the default).  With
`apiOrigins` set, developers may rely on `config.apiOrigin` as the base for API
URLs.

Developers should store styles in [`assets/styles`](assets/styles) and load them
from [`assets/styles/index.scss`](assets/styles/index.scss).

Developers should use [getFormFields](forms.md) to retrieve form data to send to
an API.

To deploy a browser-template based SPA, run `grunt deploy`.

## Tasks

Developers should run these often!

-   `grunt nag` or just `grunt`: runs code quality analysis tools on your code
    and complains
-   `grunt reformat`: reformats all your code in a standard style
-   `grunt <server|serve|s>`: generates bundles, watches, and livereloads
-   `grunt test`: runs any automated tests, depends on `grunt build`
-   `grunt build`: place bundled styles and scripts where `index.html` can find
    them
